 disneyland.2.d:0 "An attack of utterly devastating proportions has struck the Happiest Place on Earth today. Just moments ago, a large plane has flown over Disneyland, and dropped its payload. The payload exploaded about 300 feet in the air, causing damage that is greater than the Halifax Explosion mere decades ago. The current whereabouts of Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks are unknown, causing the leadership to collapse. A small group of democratic sympathisers, lead by Ronald Reagan, have assumed control of the country."

 nuke_dropped.14.t:0 "Atomic Bombing of Disneyland"
 nuke_dropped.14.d:0 "What was once the Happiest Place on Earth has now been turned into nuclear ash. Due to its significance as the only theme park to serve as a nation's capital, and because of its close proximity to the United States, no one had expected that it would be subject to an attack of such a magnitude. The whereabouts of Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks are currently unknown, destablising the country.\n\nSurvivors of the attack, as well as people in the nearby cities of Anaheim and Los Angeles, have began to evacuate especially as the fallout of the attack is expected to spread into the United States. It is truly the Saddest Place on Earth now."
